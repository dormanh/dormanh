### Hi, I'm Hanga DormÃ¡n ðŸ‘‹

I'm currently studying computational and cognitive neuroscience in Budapest, Hungary. I focus on the computational modeling of cognition, and the statistical analysis of neural activity in connection to behavior. More specifically, my interests include:
* Spatial cognition
* The relationship between spatial and temporal representations
* Navigation in abstract spaces
* Learning abstract concepts and understanding logic

In addition, I am teaching assistant in the *Programming and Theory of Algorithms* course at Rajk College for Advanced Studies. My page also contains some projects that are related to my earlier studies, and forks of repositories created by others.

I do all my projects in **Python**. Here is a quick guide to my repositories:
