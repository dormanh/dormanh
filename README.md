### Hi, I'm Hanga DormÃ¡n ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Python programmer and data scientist with a broad interest in data-driven and / or creative projects.

I studied computational and cognitive neuroscience in Budapest, Hungary. I defended my MSc thesis in Feb 2021, the topic of which was the neural encoding of three-dimensional space, and I have participated in related research since then. (Some of that work hasn't been published yet, so I'm keeping the source code private for now.) Apart from my academic endeavors, I have some work experience in financial data analysis, I taught logic, programming and network science to beginners, and did various other projects in Python.

Here is a quick guide to my repositories:
